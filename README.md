# Bittensor Pylon

**Bittensor Pylon** is a high-performance, asynchronous proxy for a Bittensor subnet. It provides a RESTful API to query subnet data and interact with the network.

This repository contains two main packages:

-   **`pylon_service`**: The core REST API service.
-   **`pylon_client`**: A lightweight client library for interacting with the service.

For detailed information on the architecture, API endpoints, and setup instructions, please see [AGENT.md](AGENT.md).
